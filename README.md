Completely custom designed Traders/Spawn Points/DMS Missions/Nuclear Fallout Island and MORE!!!

Working addons and scripts:

-DMS ~ Missions including Custom Fallout Island and Fallout Island Bridge Missions

-Occupation ~ Town Occupation/Missions

-VEMF ~ Additional mission system

-Enigma Revive ~ Revive with Defib, configured into trader

-ExileZ ~ Zombies with fixed loot and death

-Extended Base ~ Additional Buildings

-Advanced Towing/SlingLoading/Rappelling/UrbanRappelling ~ Self Expl. Depends on mods

-ExAd XM8 Apps ~ Virtual Garage

-IgiLoad ~ Towing System

-RHS Vehicles/Weapons/Units ~ Depends on mods

Finally,

There is enough support with each and everyone of the components of this so I will not be offering individual support on the addons or scripts. However I'm here to offer advice or lessons learned.
